# Introduction

Prior to the development of the transformer model, there has been many architectural
models built in hopes of best achieving true artificial intelligence. In this blog,
I am not aiming to give full technical and mathematical understanding of the underlying
components of the transformer model, rather my goal is to give you an overview of what
truly makes the transformer architecture amazing, while providing additional resources
for anyone interested in learning further details.

The transformer model consists of the following main components:

- Encoder
- Feed Forward Neural Networks
- Multi-Head Attention
- Layer Normalization
- Decoder

Before we start explaining what each component does, there are a few important points
to keep track of, especially for those not in the field:

- For the sake of simplicity, I will be reffering to the inputs and outputs of the transformers
  as "words", even though in reality, the transformer operates on a unit called the **token**
  which is roughly equivalent to 3/4 of a word.

- There will be some additional details added at the bottom of the page, which I left
  there because I believe it would make better sense after understand the gist of what each component does.

- To truly make the ideas stick, I will use the sentence example " "
- Lastly, instead of thinking of the transformer as some form of magic that gives
  artificial intelligence it's "thinking" capacity, it would be a lot easier to move
  forward thinking of it as a "next-word" predictor. This will start to make sense the deeper
  we dive into the details.

## Encoder

The encoder is responsible for creating meaningful numeric representation of input.
The details of how this is done is not important for now, just know that through
some mathematical transformations, all words can be represented with a single long vector.

## Feed Forward Neural Network

This is the simplest form of Neural Networks. Think of a neural network similarly
to how you'd think of the neurons in our brains and how interconnected they are
together. Each layer of the neural network "fires" (in technicality, a series
of vectors is passed through different functions and moves to the next layer of neurons)
to the proceeding layers and so on, until the last layer comes out with an output
— typically a score for all the words in the predefined vocabulary, the word with the
highest score will be picked, however this will lead to deterministic results
to the same input everytime. As a result, different techniques have been developed
to avoid picking the same word everytime to provide a different response everytime.

## Normalization Layers

Think of these layers, almost as a form of reset on the numbers being passed from each layer to the next.
Why would we need to reset the values? well, sometimes the values can get too large
or too small, skewing the learning process of our neural network. The normalization
does not entirely reset the value, but rather it performs a mathematical function that
keeps the value within a certain range no matter how large or small it originally was.
This helps us avoid the problem of overly large/small numbers.

## Multi-Head Attention Block

Is the core revolutionary component of the transformer model, the attention block
itself deserves it's own article, however we will explain the gist of what the
attention mechnism is and what it does.

_"Determines how relevant a word is in a sentence, relative to the other words in that sentence."_

If you understand that sentence, the implications of what makes this mechanism game
changing becomes obvious. To be able to grade the relevance of a certain word
relative to all the other words in a given sentence or paragraph makes the Aritifical
Intelligence much more capable of understanding what the "weight" of those words mean.

Again, this happens due to a series of mathematical calculations, while that is
out of the scope of this article, many are familiar with the dot-product as a
method of determining the distance between two vectors. Recall the encoder mentioned
earlier? since words (or tokens) can be represented using vectors, performing dot-product
calculations between the vector representations of each word in a sentence
relative to the other words in that sentence, will actually give us a form of
"similarity test", originally, the test will be a raw score which is then passed to a function
(softmax) and will produce a vector of percentages representing the likelihood each word
in the vocabulary has to being next.

## Decoder

Somewhat similar to the encoder, the decoder uses the encoder's vector representations
then **autoregressively** generates one word (token) at a time.
